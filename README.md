Senior Design Project: Autonomous RoverBot using Scene Analysis.

The project covers all the major aspects of Computer Engineering from software to hardware and from signaling to control. We developed an autonomous vehicle which was remotely controlled through a base station. The vehicle is fitted with a wireless video camera which transmits video to a base station where it processed through Matlab. The base station, then submits controlling signals to the vehicle to navigate through its course. Such a robot could be used for surveillance, scanning pipes (through manual or limited autonomous control) and tracking moving objects.
